This is just a basic text editor called "nano" that is available on nearly all computers.

Key UNIX cmds include:

pwd: print working directory, where are we?
ls: list's files in current location
cd: change directory, navigate to a new location
PATHs: A very important concept that relates to the file structure
mkdir: make directory, make a new file or folder/directory
rm: remove/ delete, DANGEROUS!
nano: text editor
cp: copy file or directory to a new one
less: to view contents of files ("q" to exit)
